## Introduction to Standard UNIX Access Control


1. Access to file and operation is determined by **User UID** or user's membership **Group ID**

2. Objects (file, directory, process) have owner, Owners have board control over their objects

3. You own the object you create.

4. The `root` (UID 0) can act as the owner of any object.

5. Only the `root` can perform certain sensitive administrative operations.
	+ Creating device file
	
	+ Setting the system clock
	
	+ Rasing resource usage limits and process priorities
	
	+ Setting the system's hostname
	
	+ Configuring network interface
	
	+ Opening privilaged network ports (thos numbered below 1024)
	
	+ Shutting down the system
	
	  


These Identities are stored in:

- User ID are mapped in  `/etc/passwd`
- Group ID are mapped in `/etc/group`

## The Four User IDs of a Linux Process

**Process ownership:** A process runs under specific **User Identity **, Which determine what files it can acess and what actions it can perform. Precess can have multiple identities:
  - Raal, effective, save UID
  - Real, effective, save GID

+ It determines **what the process is allowed to do** , including:
  + What file it can access 
  + What system calls it can make.
  + What capabilities it has.

 Breakdown of UIDs

| UID field      | Meaning                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Read UID       | Who started the process                                      |
| Effective UID  | Used for permission checked by the **kernel/VFS**            |
| Saved UID      | Stored UID for temporarily dropping and regaining privileges |
| Filesystem UID | Used by VFS file system access (may differ with `setfsuid()`in some casesüß†) |





 Breakdown of UIDs

![UIDs](/Users/hojat/Documents/github/mine/hojat-gazestani.github.io/public/ProjectPic/UIDs.png)



+ This **UID** is stored in the `cred` structure (`current->srec->uid`) of the process.



## A Practical Example: The Nginx Web Server

![root-privilage](/ProjectPic/root-privilage.png)



Nginx master and worker process

```sh
sudo ps aux | grep nginx
root         712  ... nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -c /usr/local/www/nginx.conf
www-data     713  ... nginx: worker process
```



`nginx` starts as `root` (PID 712)

+ The **master prcess** run as root to perform  **privilaged operations** binding to port 80

```sh
hojat@base:~$ sudo cat /proc/712/status | grep -E "^Uid|^Gid"
Uid:	0	0	0	0 		# root (real, effective, saved, fs User IDs)
Gid:	0	0	0	0			# root (real, effective, saved, fs Group IDs)
```



Then it spawns worker processes as `www-data` (PID 713)

+ This have **reduced privilege ** for security
+ **can't access root-owned files** unless explicitly permitted.

```sh
hojat@base:~$ sudo cat /proc/713/status | grep -E "^Uid|^Gid"
Uid:	33	33	33	33		# www-data (real, effective, saved, fs User IDs)
Gid:	33	33	33	33		# www-data (real, effective, saved, fs Group IDs)
```




## Why this Matters

+ Example of **privilege separation**
+ The master process `root` sets up things
+ The worker process `www-data` handle untrusted client input with **minimal privileges**
+ Even if one is exploited, damage is limited by UID isolation



## Test scenario 

```go
cat upload.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"os"
)

const uploadPath = "/var/www/html/upload"

func uploadHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	if r.Method == http.MethodGet {
		fmt.Fprint(w, `<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html lang="en">
			<head><meta charset="UTF-8"><title>Upload</title></head>
			<body>
			<form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
				<input type="file" name="file">
				<input type="submit">
			</form>
			</body>
			</html>`)
	}

	if r.Method == http.MethodPost {
		file, header, err := r.FormFile("file")
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "Error reading file: "+err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
			return
		}
		defer file.Close()

		dstPath := fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", uploadPath, header.Filename)
		dst, err := os.Create(dstPath)
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "Permission denied: "+err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
		defer dst.Close()

		_, err = io.Copy(dst, file)
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, "Failed to save file: "+err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}

		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Upload successful: %s", dstPath)
	}
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", uploadHandler)
	fmt.Println("Server started on :8080")
	http.ListenAndServe("0.0.0.0:8080", nil)
}
```



Build and run with root



```sh
root@base:/usr/local/bin# ls -la
total 18M
drwxr-xr-x  2 root  root  4.0K Jul 15 12:46 .
drwxr-xr-x 11 root  root  4.0K Jul 10 09:25 ..
-rw-rw-r--  1 hojat hojat 1.3K Jul 15 12:46 upload.go
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  root  6.1M Jul 15 12:46 upload-server

root@base:/usr/local/bin# go build -o upload-server upload.go
root@base:/usr/local/bin# sudo -u www-data ./upload-server
Server started on :8080
```



`www-data` user dont have write access so it will fail

```sh
root@base:~# chown -R root /var/www/html/upload/
root@base:~# chmod 700 /var/www/html/upload/

# Upload will fail
Permission denied: open /var/www/html/upload/Juli - 2025.pdf: permission denied


```



Changing owner to `www-data`  solved the problem



```sh
root@base:~# chown -R www-data /var/www/html/upload/
root@base:~# chmod 700 /var/www/html/upload/

Upload successful: /var/www/html/upload/Juli - 2025.pdf
```





## Saved UID: The `passwd` Command



```sh
‚ùØ ls -la /usr/bin/passwd
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 64152 May 30  2024 /usr/bin/passwd

```

+ The `s` in `-rws` means it's a `setuid` binary.
+ When a normal user (UID: 1000) runs it:

![passwd-uids](/Users/hojat/Documents/github/mine/hojat-gazestani.github.io/public/ProjectPic/passwd-uids.png)

## Conclusion

Understanding the distinction between Real, Effective, Saved, and Filesystem UIDs is fundamental to mastering Linux security and system programming. This model allows Linux to:

- **Elevate privileges** securely (e.g., `passwd`, `sudo`).
- **Drop privileges** for safety (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
- **Implement robust privilege separation**, minimizing the impact of a security breach.

By controlling how processes interact with the system's resources, Linux maintains a flexible and powerful security environment.
