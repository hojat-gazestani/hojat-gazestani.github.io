# System Management Daemons

**Spontanous Processes** are created in user space by kernel:
- Kernel start them autonomously
- Don't necessarily correspond to programs in the filesystem
- Not configurable
- Low PID listing by `ps` command
- Have bracket around them

**init** tasks to transition from from bootstrapping to multiuser mode:
- Setting the name of the compuster
- Setting the time zone
- Checking disks with **fsck**
- Mounting filesystems
- Removing old files from the **/tmp** directory
- Configuring network interface
- Configuring packet filters
- Starting up other daemons and network services

# systemd

- dependency model among server and targets
- run level
- parallel process management
- parallel network connection management
- journald
- logind

**Unix philosophy:**

- keep system components small, simple, and modular

**systemd**

- have monolithic control over of the OS's other subsystems
- breeds complexity
- potential security weaknesses
- imposing new standards and responisbilities on the linux kernel

## Core systemd Concepts: Units and Unit Files

`systemd` manages resources through objects called **Units**. A unit is defined by a configuration file called a **unit file**.

### Common Unit Types:
*   **`.service`:** A system service (e.g., `sshd.service`).
*   **`.socket`:** An inter-process communication socket.
*   **`.device`:** A device file recognized by the kernel.
*   **`.mount` & `.automount`:** Filesystem mount points.
*   **`.swap file`:** 
*   **`.partition`:** 
*   **`.target`:** A group of units (like a "runlevel").
*   **`.timer`:** A timer for scheduling tasks (a cron-like alternative).

### Where to Find Unit Files:
Unit files are looked for in these directories, with local configuration taking precedence over system defaults:
*   `/etc/systemd/system/` (Local administrator-configured units)
*   `/run/systemd/system/` (Runtime units)
*   `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` or `/lib/systemd/system/` (Default installed units)



## Practical systemctl Commands

The main tool for interacting with `systemd` is the `systemctl` command.

**Managing Services:**
```bash
systemctl enable ssh
# Will create the following symbolink link
/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/sshd.service → 
/usr/lib/systemd/system/sshd.service

# Check the status of a service
systemctl status nginx.service

# Start, stop, restart, or reload a service
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx  # Reload configuration without dropping connections

# Enable a service to start automatically at boot
sudo systemctl enable nginx

# Disable automatic start at boot
sudo systemctl disable nginx

```



**Blocking a Service (Masking):**
To completely prevent a service from starting, even manually, you can **mask** it. This creates a symlink to `/dev/null`.

- administratively blocked
- systemd knows about the unit but has been forbidden from activating it,
- or acting on any of its congiuration directory



```bash
sudo systemctl mask nginx.service
sudo systemctl unmask nginx.service # To reverse it
```





Commonly used systemctl subcommands

| Subcommand                     | Fucntion                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **list-Unit-fils** [*pattern*] | Shows installed units; Optionally matching pattern    |
| **enable** *unit*              | Enables unit to activate at boot                      |
| **disable** *unit*             | Prevents unit from activating at boot                 |
| **isolate** *target*           | Changes operating mode to target                      |
| **start** *unit*               | Activates unit immediately                            |
| **stop** *unit*                | Deactivates unit immediately                          |
| **restart** *unit*             | Restarts (or starts, if not running) unit immediately |
| **status** *unit*              | Shows unit’s status and recent log entries            |
| **kill** *pattern*             | Sends a signal to units matching pattern              |
| **reboot**                     | Reboots the computer                                  |
| **daemon-reload**              | Reloads unit !les and systemd con!guration            |





### Viewing System State:

```bash
# List all active units
systemctl list-units

# List all available unit files
systemctl list-unit-files

# List only service-type units
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

### Working with Targets (Runlevels):

```bash
# Get the default target (runlevel)
systemctl get-default

# Set the default target to multi-user (no GUI)
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target

# Change the current target (e.g., to graphical)
sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
telinit 4
```

### Static unit

have no installation procedure can't truly be said to be enabled or disabled

```
systemctl start   - > become active
```







## Advanced Configuration: Overrides and Masking

Never edit the default unit files in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`. Instead, use overrides.

**Creating a Service Override:**

```bash
# Create a directory for overrides for the nginx service
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/

# Create an override file to change the ExecStart command
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/override.conf
```



Add the following to the override file:

```bash
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx -c /usr/local/www/nginx.conf -g 'daemon off;'
```



```bash
# Reload systemd's configuration to apply the override
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```







### Logging



**Basic Log Viewing:**

```bash
# View the entire journal, starting at the end
journalctl -f

# View logs for a specific unit (service)
journalctl -u nginx

# View logs from the previous boot
journalctl -b -1
```



**Making Journals Persistent:**
By default, logs may not survive a reboot. To enable persistent storage:



```bash
journalctl
# Retain messages from prior boots


sudo mkdir -p /var/log/journal
sudo systemctl restart systemd-journald

# Or

sudo vim /etc/systemcd/journald.conf
	[Journal]
	Storage=persistent

journalctl  --list-boots

journalctl -u ntp
```



## The systemd Philosophy Debate

`systemd` famously challenges the classic Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well." It's a large, integrated suite of tools rather than a collection of small, single-purpose programs.

- **Pros:** Faster boot times via parallel startup, strong dependency management, and unified configuration and logging.
- **Cons:** Critics argue it's overly complex, monolithic, and creates a single point of failure or security concern.



## Conclusion

`systemd` is the backbone of modern Linux distributions. Moving beyond simple `service` and `chkconfig` commands to master `systemctl` and `journalctl` is a crucial step in effective system administration. Start by inspecting the units on your system, practice enabling and creating simple overrides, and use `journalctl` to debug issues—you'll be managing your system like a pro in no time.
