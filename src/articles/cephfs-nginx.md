I've also created a YouTube video tutorial for this setup:

All commands are available through my [GitHub](https://github.com/hojat-gazestani/openstack/blob/main/Ceph/octapus/08-cephfs-file-storage.md).

## ðŸ“¡ Cluster Monitoring Commands
Here are monitoring commands to observe the health and state of ceph cluster and CephFS. These tools help you to keep an eye on the cluster status and changes.

```bash
ceph -w
watch ceph orch ps
watch ceph osd pool ls
watch ceph orch ls
```

## ðŸ“¦ Create and Authorize CephFS Volume
Create a new CephFS volume `cephfs-nginx` and take a look at its status.

```bash
ceph fs volume create cephfs-nginx

ceph fs ls
ceph mds stat
ceph fs status
```
