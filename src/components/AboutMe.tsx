        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>
          I have over 10 years of experience in Development and Operations. Currently, I work as a freelance 
          Kubernetes, AWS, and DevOps engineer, where I implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines and GitOps environments. 
          My expertise lies in setting up and managing Kubernetes clusters, and providing deployment solutions within these environments.

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My tech journey began in the era of dial-up internet and floppy disks, programming with PASCAL and Delphi. However, 
          it was C++ that truly ignited my passion for coding, with the guidance of a skilled teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          The discovery of Ubuntu and the open-source culture was a turning point in my career. Initially, I struggled with graphic 
          driver issues and the Linux terminal, but these challenges sparked my interest in Cisco systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent years mastering routing, switching, data center architecture, security, and network design through Cisco. Over time, 
          I expanded my skillset by learning Python to automate and optimize infrastructure tasks, improving my expertise in cloud security, 
          microservices, and DevOps practices.
